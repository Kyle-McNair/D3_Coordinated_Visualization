            <p>Chicago is one of the largest cities in the United States. However, the city is also known to have many shifts within its demographics. With a total
                of 77 neighborhoods, there is a noticeable trend of which areas have more income based on education, who owns vs rents housing, and who has health insurance.  </p>
